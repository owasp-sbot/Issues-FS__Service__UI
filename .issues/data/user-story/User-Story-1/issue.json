      "Briefs and plan documents (markdown) render in the UI with full formatting",
      "Can link a brief document to an issue as an attachment or embedded content",
      "Can add review comments and approval status to brief-linked issues",
      "Navigation between related issues and their briefs is seamless"

    "notes": "This is critical for the Conductor workflow — the human stakeholder needs a way to review agent outputs without switching to file explorers or editors. The refactoring plan at roles/Issues-FS__Dev__Role__Architect/docs/plan__phase-2-refactoring.md is the first real use case."
